\begin{abstract}
Extrapolation methods for ordinary differential equations naturally 
admit an efficient parallel implementation that can take advantage
of typical modern laptops, workstations or compute nodes with several
processors.  We present such a parallel implementation and show that it
outperforms existing standard solvers for a range of problems, as long
as the derivative evaluation is moderately expensive.  The solver is
implemented in pure Python and is thus highly portable and very easy to read.
Features include adaptive step size and order control as well as dense output.

\section{Introduction}
Introduce extrapolation methods here and review previous work.

\section{Parallel Extrapolation}
Describe algorithmic details including parallel load balancing, adaptivity, and dense output.

\section{Numerical results}
In this section we compare our code to $DOPRI5$ and $DOP853$ integrators from $scipy.integrate.ode$. We ran the comparison test on three problems: N-body problem, Burgers' equation, and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. For each problem, we compared the relative global error in the final solution vs. wall clock time. The reference solutions used for each problem were computed at tight tolerances. The tests were run on a workstation with two 2.66 GHz quad-core Intel Xeon processors.

\subsection{N-body problem}
We tested with $N = 400$. The initial time was 0, and the final time was set to $T = 0.008$.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../images/nbod_problem_err_vs_time.png}
\centering
\caption{Runtime versus achieved relative error for N-body problem}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Burgers' equation ($u_t+uu_x=\epsilon u_{xx}$)}
We transform Burgers' equation to a non-stiff ODE by taking the Fourier transform and replacing each $x$-derivative by $i\xi$. We get the equivalent ODE
\begin{align*}
\hat{U}'(t) = - \frac{i\xi}{2} e^{\left( \xi^2 \epsilon t \right)} 
  \mathcal{F} \left\{
      \left[
          \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left(
              e^{\left( -\xi^2 \epsilon t \right)}\hat{U}
          \right)
      \right]^2
  \right\}
\end{align*}
Here $\mathcal{F}$ is the Fourier transform, and $\hat{U} = e^{\xi^2 \epsilon t} \hat{u}$ ($\hat{u}$ is the Fourier transform of $u$).

We tested with $\epsilon = 0.1$, $x \in [-\pi,\pi]$, and a grid size of $N=64$. The initial time and value were $t_0=0$ and $u(0) = \sin(x)^2$ for $x \in [-\pi,0]$ and $0$ otherwise. The final time was set to $T = 3$.

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../images/burgers_problem_err_vs_time.png}

\end{figure}

\subsection{KdV equation ($u_t+uu_x+u_{xxx}=0$)}
Similar to Burger's equation, we transform KdV equation to the equivalent non-stiff ODE
\begin{align*}
\hat{U}'(t) = - \frac{i \xi}{2} e^{\left( -i\xi^3 t \right)}
    \mathcal F \left\{
        \left[ \mathcal F^{-1} \left( e^{\left(i\xi^3 t \right)} \hat{U} \right) \right]^2
    \right\}.
\end{align*}
Here $\mathcal{F}$ is the Fourier transform, and $\hat{U} = e^{\left( -i\xi^3 t \right)} \hat{u}$ ($\hat{u}$ is the Fourier transform of $u$).

We tested with $x \in [-\pi,\pi]$, and a grid size of $N=256$. The initial time and value were $t_0=0$ and $u(0) = 3*25^2/\cosh(0.5*(25*(x+2.)))^2 + 3*16^2/\cosh(0.5*(16*(x+1)))^2 $. The final time was set to $T = 0.003$.

\section{This is an example of Appendix section head}

Channel-switching time is measured as the time length it takes for
motes to successfully switch from one channel to another. This
parameter impacts the maximum network throughput, because motes
cannot receive or send any packet during this period of time, and it
also affects the efficiency of toggle snooping in MMSN, where motes
need to sense through channels rapidly.

By repeating experiments 100 times, we get the average
channel-switching time of Micaz motes: 24.3 $\mu$s. We then conduct
the same experiments with different Micaz motes, as well as
experiments with the transmitter switching from Channel 11 to other
channels. In both scenarios, the channel-switching time does not have
obvious changes. (In our experiments, all values are in the range of
23.6 $\mu$s to 24.9 $\mu$s.)

\section{Appendix section head}

The primary consumer of energy in WSNs is idle listening. The key to
reduce idle listening is executing low duty-cycle on nodes. Two
primary approaches are considered in controlling duty-cycles in the
MAC layer.
